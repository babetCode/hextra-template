# Babet's Hextra Template

This website was created to store and share my projects.

## References
This site was built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Hextra](https://imfing.github.io/hextra/). Flowcharts were rendered with [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/), LaTeX was rendered with [KaTeX](https://katex.org/), and diagrams were produced with [Asymptote](https://asymptote.sourceforge.io/).
